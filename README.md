# Giovanni-s-DarkRP-Rank-System

no cap, here it is, super simple and easy.

open the cfg file, edit what you want.

in-game. use !gpromote and !gdemote (not case sensitive), you can then write the name, steamID or steamID64 of a connected player to promote or demote them.
you may also add a number after the name to set the player to said rankID (starts from 0, goes up)
Use !gmenu to open the GUI menu where you can perform several actions regarding a player's rank. 

CAMI permissions or superadmin to promote without having the needed rank.

if you have any issues or questions feel free to messege me on discord: Giovanni Monti#5749
