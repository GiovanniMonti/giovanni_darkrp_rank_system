# Giovanni-s-DarkRP-Rank-System

Configuration instructions are in darkrp_ranks/sh_drpranks_cfg.lua

in-game: use !gpromote and !gdemote (not case sensitive), you can then write the name, steamID or steamID64 of a connected player to promote or demote them.
you may also add a number after the name to set the player to said rankID (starts from 0, goes up)
Use !gmenu to open the GUI menu where you can perform several actions regarding a player's rank. 

CAMI permissions or superadmin to promote without having the needed rank.

Data is saved in a simple JSON file in data/drpranks on serverside, due to the low size of saved data i dont believe SQL to be necessary.
